"Welcome to the Smart Wheelchair Control System repository! üõãÔ∏è This project offers a comprehensive solution for modeling a smart wheelchair system, designed to enhance mobility and independence for individuals with mobility disabilities.

Key Features:

Initialization: The wheelchair starts with a fully charged battery, records its position, and generates obstacles.
User Preferences: Store and retrieve user preferences, including battery level and distance traveled.
Directional Motion: Supports left, right, forward, and backward movement, with obstacle avoidance algorithms.
Navigation to Destination: Autonomous navigation to specified coordinates while avoiding obstacles.
Battery Management: Reset distance traveled, adjust battery level, or charge to maximum capacity.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Control buttons for movement, battery charging, and destination input, along with visualization widgets.
Visualization: Utilizes matplotlib to visually represent wheelchair location and obstacles on a 2D grid.
Usage:
Instantiate a SmartWheelchair object and use the run method to initiate the program. Control the wheelchair via the GUI, enabling destination specification and adjustment of preferences.

Join us in revolutionizing mobility assistance technology and empowering individuals with mobility impairments. Let's make a difference, one wheel at a time! üöÄ"
